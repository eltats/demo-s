		Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>

	<p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up.
		I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason:
		this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives
		in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will
		dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
	<p class="uppr">to leon werth when he was a little boy</p>

	<p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called <span class="crsve">True Stories from Nature</span>,
		about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
		Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>

	<p>In the book it said: <span class="crsve">"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able 
		to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</span></p>
